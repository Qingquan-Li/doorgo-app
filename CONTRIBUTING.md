1. Create a new issue on GitHub (optional), e.g., `Create a bottom navigation bar`.
2. Create a new (feature) branch from the `dev` branch, e.g., `(dev) $ git checkout -b #bottom-navbar`.
3. Work on your branch, and push your branch to GitHub, e.g., `(#bottom-navbar) $ git push --set-upstream origin #bottom-navbar`.
4. When you push a new branch to GitHub (or create a pull request), your branch code is automatically deployed on Cloudflare Pages (for front-end code only), and a URL is created for you to preview and test, e.g., https://bottom-navbar.doorgo.pages.dev/
5. Once you're done with your branch, create a pull request to merge your branch into the `dev` branch. Close the corresponding issue if you created one before.
6. Request code review.
