# Door Go App

Door Go â€” A Crowdsourced App to Enhance Storefront Accessibility for Visually Impaired Individuals.

* Designing a crowdsourced app to enhance storefront accessibility for visually impaired individuals, aiming to build an open-source, accessible map of storefronts, enabling people who are blind or have low vision to navigate the city with greater independence and confidence.
* Through Door Go, volunteers can capture photos of storefronts, identify and label their accessibility features such as door types, doorknobs, ramps and stairs, as well as record the precise location of the entrances. This information is then available to visually impaired individuals - those who are blind or have low vision - allowing them to review the accessibility details of a store's door or a building's entrance, and navigate their way to an exact location.
